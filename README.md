**Employee Management System**



This is my 2nd year project where I used Java to create an employee management system using Java spring, AWT, MySQL packages. It is a desktop based application where we can manage employees in a company.


**It has following features:**
1. Add new employees to system.
2. View existing employees present in the company.
3. Update any employee.
4. Delete any employee.

**Following are the snapshots for the application:**
